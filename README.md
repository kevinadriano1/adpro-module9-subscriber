What is amqp?
AMQP stands for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol. It is a standardized protocol used for sending and receiving messages between distributed systems. AMQP enables reliable, asynchronous communication between services or applications, making it useful for building scalable systems. It supports features like message queuing, delivery guarantees, and routing. AMQP is commonly used with message brokers like RabbitMQ. This protocol helps decouple services so they can operate independently without waiting on each other.
